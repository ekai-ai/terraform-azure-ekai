# Self-service client template — "customer" stands in for a real customer
# name. Unlike dev/qa/staging/prod (Ekai's own environments), a self-service
# deployment isn't a tier — it's one client's own Azure subscription. Copy
# this file, rename it to the client's actual name, fill in the values below.
#
# The repo root and cicd/ are reusable Terraform modules (no backend block of
# their own) — this ONE tfvars file feeds the two ACTUAL state-holding root
# configs that wrap them, examples/self-deploy/root and
# examples/self-deploy/cicd (exactly like the original 4-layer design, where
# one tfvars file already served all 4 layers; each config simply ignores
# the tfvars keys it doesn't declare a variable for):
#   examples/self-deploy/root  — wraps the repo root (bootstrap + cluster +
#      platform, combined into one apply/state, down from 3 separate ones in
#      the original design)
#   examples/self-deploy/cicd  — wraps cicd/, kept as its own separate
#      apply/state, same as the original 04-cicd layer, because the ArgoCD
#      Terraform provider can only be configured from a value read from an
#      ALREADY-COMPLETED apply's state (a remote_state read), never from a
#      resource this SAME apply also creates — see cicd/main.tf's file
#      header for the full reasoning.
#
# So: 2 backend config files, 2 inits, 2 applies (in order — cicd depends on
# the root's state). Run scripts/init-state-backend.sh <name> to generate
# both (it also creates the resource group this all lives in), then:
#   cd examples/self-deploy/root
#   terraform init -backend-config=../../../env/backend-<name>.tfbackend
#   terraform apply -var-file=../../../env/<name>.tfvars
#   cd ../cicd
#   terraform init -backend-config=../../../env/backend-<name>-cicd.tfbackend
#   terraform apply -var-file=../../../env/<name>.tfvars
# (scripts/self-deploy.sh does all of this for you, in order.)
