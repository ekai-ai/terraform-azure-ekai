# DNS A record + wait_for_dns for argocd are NOT created here. The wildcard

# nginx-ingress LB Service IP directly (always populated as soon as the
# nginx Service exists) and covers `argocd.<env>.ekai.ai` automatically.
# Per-Ingress LB-IP lookups would race against Ingress status propagation
# and fail with "empty list of object" during apply.
