# Root providers (bootstrap + cluster + platform) — required_providers is the
# union of what THESE 3 submodules' trees actually use. Provider
# *configuration* blocks (provider "azurerm" {}, "kubernetes" {}, "helm" {},
# "kubectl" {}) live here — the bootstrap/cluster/platform submodules cannot
# declare their own provider config, only require providers via their own
# required_providers block (kept in each modules/<name>/providers.tf for
# documentation).
#
# provider "argocd" / "github" / "azuread" are intentionally NOT declared
# here (moved to ./cicd/providers.tf instead): nothing under
# bootstrap/cluster/platform's module tree creates an
# argocd_*/github_*/azuread_* resource — only modules/cicd does (via
# modules/microservices_CD and modules/github_action), and that module is not
# part of this root anymore. See main.tf's file header for the full reasoning
# on why cicd stays a separate apply.
#
# required_version — >= 1.7 (the strictest of the 3 submodules' own pins;
# modules/platform's conditional Key Vault secret `import` block needs
# Terraform 1.7+ for `for_each` on an import block). Terraform checks each
# submodule's own required_version block too, so this mainly documents the
# real minimum up front.

# Kubernetes/Helm/kubectl providers — configured from the cluster submodule's
# own outputs. This is a same-apply "provider configured from a resource this
# apply also creates" pattern, using AKS's STATIC kube_config cert fields
# (client_certificate/client_key/cluster_ca_certificate), not a deferred-auth
# escape hatch like AWS's `exec` block. This is the standard, documented
# pattern for a single-apply AKS + in-cluster-workloads Terraform config
# (Microsoft's own AKS + Terraform tutorials configure the kubernetes/helm
# providers this exact way) — Terraform defers actually connecting until the
# first kubernetes/helm/kubectl resource is planned/applied (all of which
# live inside the cluster/platform submodules), by which time AKS already
# exists.
