# self-deploy-destroy.sh  —  tear down what self-deploy.sh created
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/self-deploy-destroy.sh <ENV>
#
# The repo root and cicd/ are reusable Terraform modules (no backend block
# of their own — see providers.tf / cicd/providers.tf); the actual
# state-holding root configs that apply/destroy them live at
# examples/self-deploy/{root,cicd} (down from the original 4 layers, but not
# all the way to 1 — see cicd/main.tf's file header for why the cicd apply
# has to stay separate from root's). Destroy runs in reverse dependency order:
#   1. terraform destroy in examples/self-deploy/cicd FIRST — its
#      kubernetes/kubectl/argocd providers are fed directly from the root
#      config's own outputs (static AKS cert fields + the argocd provider's
#      native port_forward_with_namespace — see cicd/providers.tf), so it
#      needs the root config's cluster/ArgoCD still live to clean up
#      ExternalSecrets/the ArgoCD Application against. Unlike AWS/GCP, no
#      separate `kubectl port-forward` process or `az aks get-credentials`
#      step is needed here — Terraform's own provider config handles both.
#   2. terraform destroy in examples/self-deploy/root (bootstrap+cluster+
#      platform, combined) — Terraform sequences this internally in reverse
#      dependency order (platform, then cluster, then bootstrap — see
#      main.tf's module depends_on chain). One defensive retry: Postgres +
#      VNet subnet delegation teardown timing isn't always fully clean on
#      the first attempt (same genre of race AWS/GCP's own destroy scripts
#      retry around, though Azure's AKS/nginx-ingress/cert-manager stack
#      doesn't have AWS's ALB-specific finalizer/webhook bugs — this repo's
#      ingress/autoscaling architecture is structurally like GCP's, not
#      AWS's, so no ALB-style cleanup helpers are needed here either).
#   3. optional: delete the resource group entirely (cascades to the tfstate
#      storage account + container, and anything else left behind)
#   4. optional: delete the deployer Service Principal
#
# Each destructive stage has its own confirmation — say no to any of them and
# the rest still runs. Safe to re-run if it fails partway.
#
# Requires: az, terraform, jq, dig.
